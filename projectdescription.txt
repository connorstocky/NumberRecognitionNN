Project Description - Neural Network to Identify Handwritten Digits:

Background information:

Project Research Question:
Can a Neural Network learn to accurately predict handwritten digits?

Project Goal:
The goal of this project was to get some exposure to neural networks by completing a relatively basic 
function. At the end of this document I will reflect on the learning process. 

MNIST Data Set:
For this project I am going to be using the very common MNIST data set. The data comes with 2 seperate
csv files, one for training the neural network and then one for testing its accuracy. 
The data is formatted with one column for the label, representing the correct answer to the 
digit drawn, followed by 784 rows of pixel data. The pixel data ranges from 0-255 so in the 
code it had to be normalised from 0-1. 

Neural Networks:
Neural Networks are a learning model inspired by the function of biological processes in the brains 
of animals. Neural networks operate by having multiple layers of neurons. 
For each neuron in a layer, there is a specific weighting and bias which it 
places on the data being input to it. By starting with random weightings and biases, 
making some guesses, and then comparing the guesses to the correct answers, the network 
changes itself by altering the weightings and biases of the input data. In addition to this, 
after processing the data, an activation function can be applied before moving onto the next 
layer in order to expand the possible outputs to more complex solutions rather than just linear ones.
